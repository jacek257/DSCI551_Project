All of these filtered water containers have been great. The only complaint I have ever had with these filters is size. The Brita Ultramax Water Filter Dispenser was supposed to answer this problem. Unfortunately due to bad design, it introduced a multitude of problems that never existed with past Brita products.Pro:Size: This water dispenser can definitely hold a lot of water. (Ironically, this is really a disadvantage; as you will find below.)Con(s):Mold: If you do not let this filter dry within a maximum of two days, you will get mold. This mold will probably make you ill (sore throat) (Conversely if you look at it from another point of view - it will strengthen your immune system). To avoid this problem, the water dispenser should be washed every week at very least (to safe you should wash it more often). I have never had this problem with Brita's other products (I have friends who never washed their Brita pitchers for months, and there is not even the slightest sign of mold when they do wash it).Left Over Water: Due to the faulty design of the product, there will be left over water both above the filter and below it. Besides turning the product upside down, you cannot dispense all of the water. This is just stupid and hints at the lack of quality assurance testing of this product. Not surprisingly, this helps further contribute to mold growth.Conclusion:Save your money and buy Brita's other well designed pitchers or even Pure's pitchers. (The key word is pitcher.)

The twist and click feature failed to hold the pen in the advanced position, so whenever I would bear down to write, it would retract and push up into the pen again.So, I bought another, thinking I must have done something wrong. Carefully, after the ink ran out in 2 weeks this time (guess I did more writing), I changed the cartridge again. Same thing. At a high price tag ($8-9) for a plastic pen, I bought a third and gave it one more try.

I have since learned from various sources that those claims may be a touch exaggerated. But now that I own one myself and am starting to make daily use of it, I'm beginning to see, at least, why Moleskine notebooks have so many fans.For more than ten years, I've used a calendar/day planner/all-your-information-in-one-place system that isn't just a notebook but has an entire philosophy about how you're supposed to live your life tied into it. I never bought into that aspect of the company, but have grown used to having one reference containing all that stuff between two covers, and with a place for a pen besides. Going from that to a Moleskine, with its one small pocket in the back and no place to put a writing instrument, is definitely a switch. It's the part of the change I'm least sure about. On the other hand, the Moleskine definitely wins for portability, ease of use, style, and handiness-to-have-around in case of brainstorms.So I'm still not completely sold that this is the best of all possible notebooks. But it's definitely a good one, and I do appreciate both the attractiveness of the design and the quality of the construction. Sure, you can get a serviceable notebook for about a tenth of the price, and a whole \"lifestyle system,\" updated annually, for quite a bit more. It's all a matter of taste, and my taste is starting to run in this direction"}, {"unique_id": "B00069DKVG:will_buy_another!:sysop", "unique_id_1": "54954", "asin": "B00069DKVG", "product_name": "Moleskine Small Ruled Notebook - The Legendary Notebook of Hemingway, Picasso, and Chatwin - Moleskin Blank Book Journal Designed in Italy: Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "product_type_1": "office products", "helpful": "8 of 8", "rating": "4.0", "title": "Will buy another!", "date": "June 30, 2006", "reviewer": "Sysop", "reviewer_location": "Dayton, Ohio", "review_text": "I bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version.

I suppose that those people who still care enough about the physical writing experience of pen to paper might be more inclined to romanticize it (in other words, not only great notebooks, see below, but also smart marketing, and more power to them). I also enjoy writing, but with respect to the little 3.5\" x 5\" books, on a purely practical level, I like these simply because there are very few notebooks out there that provide such a high quality writing experience in such a small volume of space. The little (3.5\" x 5\") softcover is almost ideal for shoving in your back pocket and carrying everywhere, with  nice, high quality paper. The covers are durable and smooth enough to still work well even after acquiring some \"character\" in your back pocket (ie they actually mold to your [...] a bit!).  I haven't tried a fountain pen in it; although I enjoy writing with them, I wouldn't use one in this application anyway. These little books are not really for writing the Great American Novel (or the Great Novel of Your Country of Origin), they're more for jotting notes or to-do lists, and they work extremely well in this role. The only reason I withhold one star is the lack of a feature that would make them completely perfect for me; a pen attachment/enclosure provision. My ideal book would be able to accomodate a thin pen in the spine, so that the book could be slid into my pocket easily with no fear of snagging or worry about whether I remembered to \"click\" the pen to retract it.  I realize this would make it a bit bulkier, though. As it is, my leading pen choices for this are the Fisher Space pen or the Zebra G-301 medium point gel retractable, the former being very, very short (but a bit thicker) when capped, and the latter being very nice and skinny, but longer.  Anyway, these notebooks are a pleasure to use, and though a bit costly, for how long they last me and the pleasure (and utter utility) I get from using them, they seem like a \"reasonable extravagance\" to me.

Buck artist's model and I was very, very happy with it. It was an enormous improvement on the old wooden models I grew up with. It is detailed in a way that the old wooden mannequins never were and it is flexible enough to put into an accurate, full-lotus position complete with the detail of having the backs of the feet resting on the thighs, and that,  is scary bendy. The only problem with it is that the neck joint, although providing a good range of motion, is very delicate and broke not long after I bought it.Now, this is not the end of the world if you have the right tools. I used a Dremel moto-tool to cut out the remnant of the original joint and to grind the head off of a narrow nail which I then heated holding it with a pair of pliers and inserted into the upper torso to make a hole and then into the bottom of the neck: problem solved. The end result is still just as flexible as when  it came out of the box with the exception of the neck's motion being limited to rotation from side to side.Apparently, this flaw is known to sideshow toys who released a new, second version of the model in two sexes and three colors. The new series has a caucasian female figure that is not *quite* as flexible as the original--among other things, the detailed full-lotus is pretty much out of the question--and it is more \"voluptous\", having larger breasts, a heavier body, broader thighs and a much stronger neck. Also, both mannequins have heads that seem just slightly out of proportion with the body... just slightly larger than they should be.Be all that as it may, the original gray pictured in the above listing and offered at a ten percent discount under list is the real thing: skinnier and far more flexible than the current model but having a flaw which makes it something of a compromise; making you choose between the genuinely superior flexibility of the original mannequin (which you may eventually have to repair) or seeking out the newer model which exchanges flexibility for sturdiness while adding features that can be summed up by the term \"sex-appeal.\"I have both models and after performing the necessary repair, I prefer the original gray and highly recommend it with the caveat that you must be very careful while handling it unless you are willing to and able to perform a fairly easy repair.I could perform it and I did which is why I rate this item as highly as I do: all in all, you can call the original gray an excellent product with a small, repairable flaw.

I suppose that those people who still care enough about the physical writing experience of pen to paper might be more inclined to romanticize it (in other words, not only great notebooks, see below, but also smart marketing, and more power to them). I also enjoy writing, but with respect to the little 3.5\" x 5\" books, on a purely practical level, I like these simply because there are very few notebooks out there that provide such a high quality writing experience in such a small volume of space. The little (3.5\" x 5\") softcover is almost ideal for shoving in your back pocket and carrying everywhere, with  nice, high quality paper. The covers are durable and smooth enough to still work well even after acquiring some \"character\" in your back pocket (ie they actually mold to your [...] a bit!).  I haven't tried a fountain pen in it; although I enjoy writing with them, I wouldn't use one in this application anyway. These little books are not really for writing the Great American Novel (or the Great Novel of Your Country of Origin), they're more for jotting notes or to-do lists, and they work extremely well in this role. The only reason I withhold one star is the lack of a feature that would make them completely perfect for me; a pen attachment/enclosure provision. My ideal book would be able to accomodate a thin pen in the spine, so that the book could be slid into my pocket easily with no fear of snagging or worry about whether I remembered to \"click\" the pen to retract it.  I realize this would make it a bit bulkier, though. As it is, my leading pen choices for this are the Fisher Space pen or the Zebra G-301 medium point gel retractable, the former being very, very short (but a bit thicker) when capped, and the latter being very nice and skinny, but longer.  Anyway, these notebooks are a pleasure to use, and though a bit costly, for how long they last me and the pleasure (and utter utility) I get from using them, they seem like a \"reasonable extravagance\" to me. I'll go through many, many of these before I spend what I would on the cheapest PDA"}, {"unique_id": "B00069DKYI:tough_call:m._m._davis_\"matt_davis\"", "unique_id_1": "334125", "asin": "B00069DKYI", "product_name": "Moleskine Large Ruled Notebook - The Legendary Notebook of Hemingway, Picasso, and Chatwin - Moleskin Blank Book Journal Designed in Italy: Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "product_type_1": "office products", "helpful": "12 of 12", "rating": "4.0", "title": "Tough call", "date": "January 9, 2006", "reviewer": "M.

Buck artist's model and I was very, very happy with it. It was an enormous improvement on the old wooden models I grew up with. It is detailed in a way that the old wooden mannequins never were and it is flexible enough to put into an accurate, full-lotus position complete with the detail of having the backs of the feet resting on the thighs, and that,  is scary bendy. The only problem with it is that the neck joint, although providing a good range of motion, is very delicate and broke not long after I bought it.Now, this is not the end of the world if you have the right tools. I used a Dremel moto-tool to cut out the remnant of the original joint and to grind the head off of a narrow nail which I then heated holding it with a pair of pliers and inserted into the upper torso to make a hole and then into the bottom of the neck: problem solved. The end result is still just as flexible as when  it came out of the box with the exception of the neck's motion being limited to rotation from side to side.Apparently, this flaw is known to sideshow toys who released a new, second version of the model in two sexes and three colors. The new series has a caucasian female figure that is not *quite* as flexible as the original--among other things, the detailed full-lotus is pretty much out of the question--and it is more \"voluptous\", having larger breasts, a heavier body, broader thighs and a much stronger neck. Also, both mannequins have heads that seem just slightly out of proportion with the body... just slightly larger than they should be.Be all that as it may, the original gray pictured in the above listing and offered at a ten percent discount under list is the real thing: skinnier and far more flexible than the current model but having a flaw which makes it something of a compromise; making you choose between the genuinely superior flexibility of the original mannequin (which you may eventually have to repair) or seeking out the newer model which exchanges flexibility for sturdiness while adding features that can be summed up by the term \"sex-appeal.\"I have both models and after performing the necessary repair, I prefer the original gray and highly recommend it with the caveat that you must be very careful while handling it unless you are willing to and able to perform a fairly easy repair.I could perform it and I did which is why I rate this item as highly as I do: all in all, you can call the original gray an excellent product with a small, repairable flaw.

I have since learned from various sources that those claims may be a touch exaggerated. But now that I own one myself and am starting to make daily use of it, I'm beginning to see, at least, why Moleskine notebooks have so many fans.For more than ten years, I've used a calendar/day planner/all-your-information-in-one-place system that isn't just a notebook but has an entire philosophy about how you're supposed to live your life tied into it. I never bought into that aspect of the company, but have grown used to having one reference containing all that stuff between two covers, and with a place for a pen besides. Going from that to a Moleskine, with its one small pocket in the back and no place to put a writing instrument, is definitely a switch. It's the part of the change I'm least sure about. On the other hand, the Moleskine definitely wins for portability, ease of use, style, and handiness-to-have-around in case of brainstorms.So I'm still not completely sold that this is the best of all possible notebooks. But it's definitely a good one, and I do appreciate both the attractiveness of the design and the quality of the construction. Sure, you can get a serviceable notebook for about a tenth of the price, and a whole \"lifestyle system,\" updated annually, for quite a bit more. It's all a matter of taste, and my taste is starting to run in this direction"}, {"unique_id": "B00069DKVG:will_buy_another!:sysop", "unique_id_1": "573647", "asin": "B00069DKVG", "product_name": "Moleskine Small Ruled Notebook - The Legendary Notebook of Hemingway, Picasso, and Chatwin - Moleskin Blank Book Journal Designed in Italy: Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "product_type_1": "office products", "helpful": "8 of 8", "rating": "4.0", "title": "Will buy another!", "date": "June 30, 2006", "reviewer": "Sysop", "reviewer_location": "Dayton, Ohio", "review_text": "I bought the 3.5 x 5.5 ruled pocket version.

This little notebook has kept itself together so far, while looking very hip.I am a software engineer/project manager and am cognisant of my technological options, this is just faster, lighter and thinner than my PDA for scribbling notes. I am never without it in the office.The back folio pocket and the elastic strap looked dumb when I first bought it. However, I use the folio pocket for receipts to be reimmbursed (better than leaving them in a pocket to be washed or thrown out)and the elastic strap serves double duty as a second bookmark and to keep the notebook together (keeping it closed helps it survive).I like the construction and archival quality of the book. My notes look more like those of a disorganized madman than a manager (I am starting to wonder if they are synonomous) but if I ever have to refer back to them I can be assured that they will be there for a long time.It only received 4 stars because they are [...] a piece and at my current scrawling rate, I will probably need about 4 or 5 a year. Just get your company to pay for it if you can, because they are notebooks that you can rely on to be there for a long while.Lastly: For the person who likes their Montblanc notebook with tear out pages, they are partially missing the point. These books are for archiving and keeping records (of questionable usefulness in my case) not for making quick throw away notes.

It is almost identical to the small ruled notebook, except for alphabetized tabs along the page edges. Unlike most address books, there are no neat boxes to fill in with names, street addresses, and city/state/ZIP; no separate spaces for home, work, and cell numbers. There are only ... lines.What this means, of course, is that you can record whatever information you choose to, however you choose to. A person can be tucked into one line, or have an entire page for herself. Moleskine makes a big deal about its notebooks being tools for the self-expression of the people who use them, and I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this philosophy extends even into the usually-mundane world of the address book.

I confidently write checks with Noodler's Black, and it is safe for signing valuable or important documents too (when black is an acceptable color; ask your lawyer).Please keep in mind that the Noodler's company carefully says which of the brand's colors are waterproof and which are not. In my experience Noodler's Black is by far the best Noodler's color for writing on both sides of bad paper.One behavior you might notice, if your pen's nib is an exposed metal surface (not covered with colored enamel), is that Noodler's (standard) Black spreads itself over exposed metal surfaces. This \"nib creep\" is harmless behavior because the ink doesn't run down onto the grip area. Wiping the ink off the nib is only temporary; more ink will soon spread to replace what you wiped off.

I was first attracted by the Stainless Ballpoint's classic stylish looks.  (I prefer the gold click & clip model, but have also used the complete silver model with pleasure.)Until my discovery of Parkers I had used Pilots, Papermates, Shaffers, and Crosses with varying degrees of success. (I left Cross pens due to their excessive costs. Shaffers easily brake.  Pilot and Papermate inks soon fade to invisibility!)  I have been using, and recommending, Parkers ever since.Parker's Stainless Ballpoint is sturdy and durable.  I have used them to print, of course, and to point, pry, and pound.  Never have I permanently damaged one.  (With excessive torque Parker Stainless pens will bend.  I have re-straightened Parkers with vice grips.)  Parker Stainless Ballpoints are rugged and take considerable abuse and keep on working.  (Once, the internal plastic clicker malfunctioned, for the only mishap I've ever experienced with a Parker.)I also like Parker's ink formula.  I began my career with blue medium and later moved to black fine.  For the past 15 years I have used Parker's fine blue.  The refills cost between 10% and 50% less than the Cross pen refills (depending on the vendor).Parker ink dries quickly (rarely leaving a smudge under left-handers).  It doesn't wobble (i.e. floating away from the point of application) as does some pithy contemporary inks.  Parker ink has brilliant color, is attractive, and easy to read.I've notice, over the years, that Parker ink does not fade. Twenty year old journal entries, tax records, and business notes are not faded to date.  (I've become curious about how long Parker ink will perform.)I have given Parker Stainless Ballpoints as gifts, awarded them for achievement, and presented them with gratitude.  They are excellent gift candidates.

It is not only to my mind the perfect medium for memorializing my sabbatical trip to the UK last spring, but it's also a great tool for collecting ideas for what to do on my (hopefully not-too-long-from-now) return trip. And it will be a most handy resource to have while I'm there. Before, during, after.If that makes the Moleskine City Notebook sound like the Swiss Army knife of guidebooks, that is intentional. The idea that drives this notebook is captured in the quotation from Aldous Huxley's 1925 essay collection \"Along the Road\" that's printed on the Moleskine's second page: \"For any traveler who has any taste of his own, the only useful guide-book will be the one which he himself has written.\" The London City Notebook contains a comprehensive set of maps (with index), followed by a bunch of blank pages and a section of tabbed pages with interesting icons. Perforated pages allow for handy notes and reminders, and there are also tracing pages \"for your itineraries and whatever.\" The reliable Moleskine back pocket contains label stickers for creating your own tabbed sections, and to help you remember where you wrote things, there are three bookmark ribbons instead of the usual single one.London and Moleskine have a special connection for me because it was in a fairly well-known legal and business bookstore on High Holborn where I saw a Moleskine display for the first time. I'm looking forward to filling this one with memories, notes, and references from that first trip and starting to put together thoughts for what to do the next time. As guidebooks go, I will definitely give \"the one which I myself have written\" pride of place on my travel bookshelf ... and if I make plans for Paris or Amsterdam, say, then their City Notebooks will show up there too"}, {"unique_id": "B00006I57A:wouldn't_use_anything_else.:kristine_gregorowicz", "asin": "B00006I57A", "product_name": "Cross Fountain Pen Ink Refills - (Black): Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "helpful": "", "rating": "5.0", "title": "Wouldn't use anything else.", "date": "January 9, 2007", "reviewer": "Kristine Gregorowicz", "reviewer_location": "Dearborn, MI USA", "review_text": "I bought a cross pen, and when I ran out of refills, I went to a local store that sold cross.

The reviews were about equal, but the \"Stealth Fighter\" looks of the Lamy won out in the end.Does it write as smoothly as my Cross?  In a word: No...  However, it does lay down a nice line and doesn't \"scratch.\"  I would compare the line to the Pilot V2 .07 Gel Pens I've been using lately.As with with most fountain pens, it does give the act of writing that \"mystical feel\" that you don't get from cheap pens.

I went to Office Depot's web site and staring me right in the face on their main page was a sale ad for this chair. Only $99 instead of the ususal $140, it said. $100 was about what I wanted to spend, and being a large indivdual, I thought it was serendipity. So I go to my local store the next day and they also have it marked for $99. I take a seat in their display model and instantly fall in love. It feels huge compared to my previous chair, a model by the same manufacturer, but cheaper and not as sturdy. I take the tag to the front to checkout, and decided to read the store's sale ad while I wait for a stocker to get my chair down from the back with a fork lift. I look in the ad just to see if my new chair is in it, but it's not. I was pleased to discover a note saying that I would recieve a $20 gift card with my $99 or up chair purcahse. Excellent, I though, but it got even better when the checker simply deducted the $20 from the purcahse price instead of giving me a gift card. So in short I was able to score this completely excellent and most comfortable chair for only $80!!! It's incredible, seriously. And the lumbar support is excellent. I can sit in this chair for hours at a time and my back doesn't hurt at all.

It's beautiful, but after a couple years of wear and hours of sitting at the computer, my neck was killing me! Keep in mind that I have a relatively physical job lifting baggage 12 hours+ at the airport, so my body is aching when I get home. I needed a comfortable chair with a high-back to rest my weary neck.I read some reviews of other chairs that say they were easy to assemble and in actuality were not.(Keep with me, I'm going to sum-up to a raving review!)I looked at a few chairs with massage features - vibrate & knead with embedded rolling balls. Well, I tried one of those chairs. The features are great, but the chairs are ultimately uncomfortable.(Here it comes, I'm going to tie this all together.)Not this chair! It is THE most comfortable chair I have EVER sat in! I wasn't sure what I was getting looking at a picture, so I went to Office Max. All their chairs sucked! I went to Office Depot and fell in love!I can sleep in this chair! I can put my head back and play at the computer with a heating pad on my neck. It's roomy and oh sooooo comfortable! Words cannot express how much I love this Chair!When I took it out of the box, I thought, \"this is going to be so hard to put together and the air lift wont work; it probably wont feel the same way it did in the store.\" WRONG! I put it together in probably 5 minutes. The clean-up was harder - picking-up the bags and throwing away the box. Why? Because I could not get out of my new chair. Heck, I may just throw away my bed and sleep right here...well, if I could get up.As for the massaging. I just may get a massaging seat pad so I can put it in my car too.If you want the full effect, get a cordless mouse and keyboard!!Trust me, you will not regret pampering yourself in cushy comfort!

Holding one allows you to imagine great people doing great things and that owning one brings you closer to them--not just writers, but musicians, scientists and mathematicians or anyone else who needed to have an idea and hold on to it.In its design, the Moleskine Reporter is a classic with convenience features that make it surprisingly modern. Its built-in rubberized cloth band keeps it from falling open when dropped; it's back pocket allows you to keep miscellaneous papers and items like receipts, stamps and photographs without making you resort to your wallet. Its featureless blank pages allow you to establish your own formatting as you work (making it perfectly suitable for combinations of notes and sketches in landscape and portrait formats)--the perfect feature when your forms of creativity require notes and drawings for visualization. Better still, its semi-hard covers give you a writing surface anywhere you have an idea, from your hand when standing on a streetcorner to your thigh during a train or plane-ride.

When I first saw them in a display in a business bookstore in London, I was taken by their design and functionality as much as by the evocative marketing. Now, about nine weeks later, I've bought my third Moleskine, this small squared \"reporter\" notebook.I know some people take their Moleskines deep into the jungle, on exotic global treks, or journey with them to the very heights of imagination or contemplation. In that spirit, I take this notebook to the harshest environment I regularly encounter: the gymnasium. My previous gym notepad eventually ended up looking pretty thrashed. I'm confident the Moleskine will fare better, both because it's smaller and because of the fairly sturdy cover.If I do have one complaint, though, it's about that cover. It doesn't flip fully over to the back, the way the cover on a spiral-bound notebook can, so when you're reading or writing in it, the top sort of flops around. (Maybe the top *does* flip over, and I just haven't brought myself to brualize the notebook that much yet. But it's not obvious it's designed to do so.) Still, it's a solid, attractive, functional, and easily portable notebook.

I've collected a few vintage and new fountain pens over the years; some of them lay in a display box, loved but unused. On contrast, you will use this pen!  It's incredibly cheap for the quality, so you get a basically positive experience (smooth flowing liquid expression) without the price, or the ultimate cost...losing the darn thing.  At prices ranging from $40 to $400 and beyond (Amazon.com sells a Namiki fountain pen for well over $4,000), the habitual loser of inanimate objects would be understandably reluctant to invest in a gold-nibbed, laquered objet-d'art, and would opt instead for this beautiful cheaply that even CALLS itself \"disposable!\"It's a personal preference, but I'd opt for the fine nib over the medium if you're going to use this everyday--you'll write faster and use less ink. The medium is nice for big John Hancock-ish signatures and weighty thoughts, but you lose a little expression (those personal shadings and slight angles that even the untrained can't help but produce). The steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly, and as mentioned above, the ink doesn;t evaporate too quickly.  You can't refill the pen (it's DISPOSABLE just because of that), but you can buy several in different colors and nib sizes, and get some idea of what kind of pen suits you.If and when you feel like you want to purchase a re-fillable fountain pen, try for something under $50.  Levenger.com's excellent \"True Writer\" and the \"Retro\" brand pens sell for about this much.  Although those liquidy smooth gel pens have taken some over some of the non-ballpoint market, the mechanically-minded will enjoy the physics of bottle-filling a pen; others will simpy dig the tradition of using a pen with a rich history.

It cracked, so I got \"commercial\" iron-on paper.  That cracked  too.  My supplier told me the iron had to be hot enough, and I had to press hard, putting my weight behind it (that's alot of weight... haha). So I bought a new iron, set it at the hottest setting, and I pressed each part of the transfer for the same length of time and I pressed hard.  But I started burning the transfers because the new iron was TOO hot.  So I set it a hair under the highest cotton setting (instead of all the way up to linen), and it was just right.  (For a whole sheet transfer, I first iron around the transfer to set it down; then I press in increments of about three inches for five long seconds, all the way across, making about four or five rows of presses to get from the top to the bottom, and then start all over again going up and down, making four or five rows of presses to get from one side to the other.  I press and lift, rather than pushing. When I'm done pressing, I move the iron in a kind of circular pattern all around the transfer again, pressing firmly.  Then I lift up one edge and peel it back a ways to check the tranfser.  If it looks good, I warm it up again where I'm going to peel, and then start peeling, and let the iron follow me so the transfer doesn't cool down as I'm peeling so I don't get shiny edges. Phew what a pain in the ***.) Anyways, just when I really got the hang of it, my supplier let me down and I couldn't get my professional paper in time for the weekend.  SO I WENT BACK TO THE HP, USING THE SAME TECHNIQUE.  It burned the first time, and so I set the iron about a half a number under what I had it set at before, and didn't iron it quite as long.  It looked really good, but I wanted to see if the transfer was strong enough, so instead of waiting, I threw it right in the washer (inside out, cold water, no bleach; knits-delicates setting on the dryer).  I was surprised how soft it was!  I couldn't even tell it was a transfer, and the color was good!  SO IT WASN'T THE HP THAT WAS THE PROBLEM INITIALLY, IT WAS ME.  If you're gonna use this stuff (or any iron-on transfer), the best thing I can tell you is to experiment on an old shirt.  Try the hottest setting first, and turn it down if it burns.  (You'll know you've burned when you see something like a tea stain on your shirt, it feels a bit fuzzy, and you'll see part of your graphic is left behind on the transfer paper when you peel it off - I think that's because instead of the ink going into the shirt, it burns back into the paper.)  Be sure to count the seconds and make sure every inch of the transfer gets an even, HARD press.  I FOUND THE CRACKING IS MAINLY DUE TO THE IRON  NOT BEING HOT ENOUGH, AND NOT PRESSING DOWN HARD ENOUGH.  THE POLYMERS GOTTA BE SQOOSHED INTO THE FABRIC.  Also, I iron onto a nice smooth piece of wood, and I don't use a pillow case or anything between the shirt and the wood, and I stretch the shirt very slightly and tuck it in so it doesn't move when I iron.  Then I let the shirt cool down slowly, before I take it off the wood (thinking if it cools down too fast, that might make it crack more). Before I got the new iron, I was ironing with a piece of sheet metal on top of the wood to conduct heat.  That was better, but the new iron, getting the temperature right, and ironing hard and evenly, did the trick for me."}, {"unique_id": "B00006IALV:classy_and_elegant:g._i._warner", "asin": "B00006IALV", "product_name": "Eldon(R) Expressions&trade; Wood Business Card Holder, Mahogany: Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "helpful": "", "rating": "4.0", "title": "Classy and elegant", "date": "January 9, 2007", "reviewer": "G.

I also don't recommend rotary blade cutters. Both of these type of cutters get blunt quickly and are quite frustrating. They are also difficult to line up exactly where you want to cut. They purport to cut through a few layers of paper, but this is simply not the case. I find it difficult even using one page in these cutters. After not very much use - such as one or two batches of whole page photos, they quickly give you burred edges and the blades need replacing often. They tell you the grips are large and easy to use, which is definitely not the case. I find the grip of this particular trimmer to be much more comfortable and user-friendly.

I write notes in class, recopy them, write down proofs over and over, as well as write out a lot of homework. Being a student means that I'm also on a budget! Thus, having a nice, inexpensive pen is key to my success.I love fountain pens over ball point pens because you don't have to press so hard to write. Pressing hard for so long turns writing into a painful task. This particular pen is actually designed for comfort and I have no problem writing with it for hours on end. It has a slightly triangular grip which makes it easy to hold, and it is also very light. The strong clip on its cap is such that the pen never rolls off any desk.The nibs or tips of these pens are very strong and can take a lot of abuse. They have the same fine craftmanship as the more expensive lamy pens, but, the body being made of a plastic makes these pens very affordable. I am no expert on plastics but the one this pen is made from is a very high quality and strong. I don't imagine the body of this pen would break even if you drove over it in a car.Adding to the inexpensiveness of these pens is that, with a converter cartridge, they are also refillable. You have to buy this cartridge separately, but it is only a few dollars, and available wherever the pens are sold. With an extra fine nib, one bottle of ink easily lasts me a year and I drain a normal pen in a day or two. The clear plastic converter cartridge is one which you twist in order to refill it. I like the cartridge much better than the more traditional squeeze and fill ink bladders which are messier and you can't see how much ink is actually in them.This pen in particular has an interesting look. It is see through, which is fun to look at but also helpful because I can see how much ink I have left and know if I need to refill it before class.A decent single use pen can cost you 5 dollars easily. The initial price of this pen is more but it will last you forever as well as spoil you with a writing quality far above that of a decent 5 dollar single use pen. Fountain pens in general have a timeless style and this one is especially good looking.

The possession is obvious: I wouldn't toss out an intact hard drive, for fear of identity theft, etc.  The same is true of your backup media.

In an emergency you can use it to shred paper, including staples.Because DVDs, CDs and Floppy Disc are dense, they lay flat, and take up very little room in the debris basket.  Since paper is light, it will bunch up, filling the debris basket fast.  If you do a lot of paper, you want to consider a paper shredder with a larger basket.Because it is shredding polycarbonate and metal, the feeder slot snuggly fits DVDs, CDs, and Floppy Discs.  This reduces the chance of high energy debris.  Do Not look into the slot while shredding.  Because of the snug slot, feeding paper into the MD100 is not quick.  If you want to shred less than 8 pages, but cannot leave your desk, you can use the MD100.  If you want to shred more than 8 pages, or can leave you desk, it is better to use a paper shredder with a larger feed slot and a larger basket.This is also a personal shredder, if you need to shred from more than two minutes at a time (approximately 24 DVDs or CDs or Floppy Discs), you should get a commercial grade machine"}, {"unique_id": "B00008HBY8:great_for_media:a._floyd", "asin": "B00008HBY8", "product_name": "Royal Media Destroyer &#45; MD100: Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "helpful": "12 of 12", "rating": "5.0", "title": "Great for media", "date": "May 13, 2004", "reviewer": "A.

The shortcomings of the Scott's standard mainstay, roughness, are not a concern here. \"Charmin Ultra\" is nearly perfect in every way.The NEW \"Gold Standard\" for the bathroom, arguably has become \"Charmin Ultra\" especially if your needs require a softer tissue than the Scott's. Scott's standard bathroom tissue is stronger than Charmin Ultra, but \"Charmin Ultra's\" strength is ample for the intended use of the product. The 2-ply construction makes the 200 sheet rolls go much farther than one might expect and does add body and mass to the product. Add to this the extra absorbency of \"Charmin Ultra\" over Scott's, and I would say that \"Charmin Ultra\" has a clear edge.THE BOTTOM LINE:Basically, these two products compare much like \"Bounty\" versus \"Viva\" paper towels. While both products score high marks in every area there are significant differences. Bounty is stonger and Viva is softer, making both choices excellent but dependent on the needs of the individual consumer.RESULTS OF OUR IN-HOUSE TRIAL BETWEEN THIS CHARMIN & \"SCOTT EXTRA SOFT\":We compared \"Charmin Ultra\" to \"Scott Super-Soft\" in what turned out to be a NO-Contest event. The \"Charmin Ultra\" is much softer than the \"Scott Extra-Soft\", though the \"Scott Extra-Soft\" is an improvement over their standard product, but still quite rough.[I am not affiliated with any product or company.]"}, {"unique_id": "B0002T4032:better_than_adequate:christian_fredrickson_\"psychogenic_articulate\"", "asin": "B0002T4032", "product_name": "Lamy Safari Charcoal Fountain Pen - Charcoal, Extra-Fine Nib L17XF: Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "helpful": "2 of 2", "rating": "4.0", "title": "Better Than Adequate", "date": "May 5, 2006", "reviewer": "Christian Fredrickson \"psychogenic articulate\"", "reviewer_location": "Minneapolis, MN USA", "review_text": "The Lamy Safari is an excellent pen: light, sturdy, attractive design that lets you monitor your level of ink.

With these pencils, it is always best to start out light and layer your colors until you get a sleek, natural result.The problem with Crayola is that the lead is too hard for blending,  i.e, 'pushing' the colors into one another. If you are the type of artist who is into such things, I suggest Prismacolor pencils.

Whether used to grade kindergarten handwriting or comment on English 101 compositions, the Pilot Precise V5 (especially in the color blue) seems to be the first choice of teachers everywhere.Rollerball pens are clearly more expensive than the commonplace ballpoint models, but justify their cost. Despite their similar name, ballpoints lack the fluid line, precise control and quality ink found in rollerballs. I make do with cheap ballpoints to take notes for medical school and on patient records in the hospital (my handwriting deserves no better), but my wife, the English Major (actually Linguist), will accept no substitutes. Joyanna loves the bright, classy blue of these pens and the way she can control the thickness of the line with the lightest touch.Pilot apparently makes use of a proprietary ink control system; it makes up that funny stack of baffles in the first part of the shaft behind the tip. With the fine, pointed tip, it makes for lines of even thickness and color with only a light touch (it can be hard to get used to for pen-mashers like me). The clear plastic ink-gage on the side is useful. Joyanna has tried slightly cheaper pens, but a 12-pack like this seems the only option that is truly satisfactory. Pilot's V7 is similar, but makes a thick 0.5 mm line instead of the thin 0.3 mm line produced by this model.The cap on the Precise V5 seals tightly and has a strong metal clip. As with all standard rollerball pens, changes in pressure on airplanes can be dangerous. Pilot tells you to hold the pen upright when removing the cap in a low-pressure plane cabin, but Joyanna still keeps her pens in a plastic bag when flying. I have seen other pens made by Pilot and other manufacturers that claim to be safe on planes, but you might as well get a cheap ballpoint to put in you carry-on.\"The Pilot Precise V5 - the official pen of the National Association of English Majors\"- NAEM, Lake Woebegone, M"}, {"unique_id": "B00006IEBI:the_greatest_pen_ever:m._neal", "asin": "B00006IEBI", "product_name": "Pilot(R) Precise(TM) V5 Liquid Ink Rollerball Pens, Extra-Fine Point, 0.5 mm, Black, Pack of 12: Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "helpful": "4 of 5", "rating": "5.0", "title": "The Greatest Pen Ever", "date": "January 19, 2004", "reviewer": "M.

I'm a big fan of Lamy's Safari for everyday writing and have been using one for years (see separate review).  The Joy is the longer, pointy-ended, calligraphic cousin of the Safari, which is also a plastic fountain pen with windows on the side.  In fact, the caps are interchangeable, and the threading joining the front and back halves of the pen is the same, so I normally write with a Joy nib section screwed into a Safari back end, since I don't like the Joy's long end section for everyday writing and carrying in my bag or pocket.  Aesthetically speaking, I like the long, tapered design of the end, which reminds me of the dip pens I used to use for art and calligraphy.  While this design is fine for a pen that lives on a desk, it's a little too long for carrying around the campus or office.  That being said, I consider this a matter of taste than a problem with the design.Like the Safari, the pen nib is durable and writes pretty smoothly and consistently...easily the best of the various pens I've tried in this lowest price range.  It's a light pen with a relatively narrow, molded grip section, so stay away if you would rather write with a hefty, chunky pen.The 1.1 mm straight chisel nib is perfect for me.  I'm a lefty, so most oblique nibs won't work.  The chisel nib is just wide enough to give my otherwise ordinary handwriting a pleasant, calligraphic and more substantial quality.  (With the right inkn and paper combination, you get beautiful variation in tone and darkness in your strokes as the ink dries.)  However, it's not so wide that I can't write with it every day, unless I need to write really small.  I write letters, take notes on standard lined paper, address envelopes, fill out forms, sign checks, etc. with this pen without worry.As an everyday user of fountain pens, I can say I really enjoy writing with this pen and the Safari, both.  However, I only dabble in calligraphy and cannot speak for this pen's appropriateness for someone who does that sort of work more seriously.  I expect this would be a good starter pen, however, for a beginning calligrapher...possibly one of the wider nib versions, if they don't expect to use it for everyday writing or fine (as in small) calligraphy work.p.s.

I followed the guy over the Charles Bridge towards Old Town, but then lost him in a crowd near the town square.  I went back to the bureau shame-faced, but my understanding superior told me to write up a detailed report about what I saw and where.

It keeps them thinking about re-cycling.4]- I can pick them up at Office Depot and avoid shipping this item.BOTTOM LINE: A REAL NO-BRAINER -- JUST CAN'T GO WRONG HERE!An excellent product that it is very easy to take for granted"}, {"unique_id": "B000ES76FU:my_daughter_loved_it!:lola", "asin": "B000ES76FU", "product_name": "Crunch Art Fabric Creations: Office Products", "product_type": "office products", "helpful": "12 of 12", "rating": "5.0", "title": "My Daughter Loved it!", "date": "June 19, 2006", "reviewer": "Lola", "reviewer_location": "Ohio", "review_text": "My daughter is 7 years old and can do this by herself with no problems.  It came with three framed art works.  She crunched them and then hung them up in her room.  Very cute!  Fun bright colors and very easy to use.  One of the things I liked best about this craft is that it wasn't messy!  That's a huge plus for me as a parent"}]
